## Hi there 👋

For reasons known only to the gods, you've reached my GitHub.  
So let me introduce myself real quick.

I’m **Chatelin**, a bilingual computer science student.
Most of the time I’m knee-deep in heavy **TypeScript**, maintaining a monorepo of my own, digging through the Arch Linux or Hyprland wiki, writing about whatever grabs my curiosity… or crying over Rust’s pickiness.

I love reading, learning, and being challenged — even when I have absolutely no idea what the h**k I’m doing.  
Somehow, thanks to the sacred art of *Googling things*, I usually get away with it.

Despite still having a lot to learn, my skillset is fairly broad:

### **Web**
React • Preact • Fresh (Deno) • TailwindCSS • Supabase • PHP/Composer

### **Mobile**
React Native • Expo

### **3D**
Spline

### **2D**
Lunacy

## Extra

That’s about it for now — but you can explore my projects to get a better sense of what I build and how I think.  
For example: [hello-worlds](https://github.com/ctlinker/hello-worlds).
